## Features

1. **Traffic Light Simulation**  
   - Models the behavior of a traffic light, including transitions between **Red**, **Yellow**, and **Green** states.

2. **Car Interaction**  
   - Simulates cars that respond to the traffic light signals, displaying realistic stopping, waiting, and moving behaviors.

3. **Graphical User Interface**  
   - Integrates a user-friendly **Qt** interface to visualize traffic light changes and car movements in real time.

4. **Object-Oriented Design**  
   - Employs **C++ classes** (`Car`, `TrafficLight`, etc.) for maintainable, modular, and extensible code.

## Project Structure

```
TrafficLightCarSimulation/
â”œâ”€â”€ Car.cpp / Car.h             # Implementation of the Car class and its attributes/behaviors
â”œâ”€â”€ TrafficLight.cpp / TrafficLight.h  # Manages traffic light states (red, yellow, green) and timing
â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp                    # Application entry point; initializes and runs the simulation
â”œâ”€â”€ mainwindow.cpp / .h / .ui   # Qt-based GUI files for visualizing the simulation
â””â”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt              # Build configuration via CMake
```
